									My Current<br />
									Projects
								</h1>
								<p>
									During my time at Staffordshire University I am to create many frameworks and games<br />
									which are displayed here. Some are finished products, whilst others may not be.<br />

							<h2><u>Rapid Games Prototyping</u></h2>
							<h3>Marble Madness:</h3>
							<p>
								Marble Madness was a 3D framework given to us at the beginning of Semester 1, which I upgraded and worked upon using C# and the Unity Game engine.
								The player attempts to move a marble in around a series of levels to reach the goal, whilst avoiding obstacles and using power-ups. For example:
								pegs that knock the player back, lava tiles which send the user to the start of the level, spinning doors, and more. <br />

							</p>
							<h3>2D Side Scroller:</h3>
							<p>
								The 2D Side Scroller was a 2D framework given to us at the beginning of Semester 1, which I upgraded and worked upon using C# and the Unity Game engine.
								Similar to Space Invaders, the player shoots at enemy ships whilst avoiding attacks in an aim to reach a new high score. Added functionality includes:
								working healthbar, healing items, different enemy types, and enemy waves. <br />

							</p>
							<h3>2D Platformer:</h3>
							<p>
								At the start of Semester 2, the first prototype we were given to improve was the 2D Platformer. Using C# and the Unity Editor, I improved this framework
								into an industry standard prototype featuring an in-depth movement and animation system for both the player, and the AI controlled enemies. Similar to other
								platformers such as Mario, or Sonic; there are several power-ups the player can collect along with a suitable score and lives system. There are three different
								levels the player can traverse to hone their skills whilst testing all functions of this project. <br />

							</p>
							<h3>Top-Down Shooter:</h3>
							<p>
								The final and largest prototype for Rapid Games was the top down shooter. This was a 2D bird's eye view shooting game, similar to an RPG or the retro Zelda title.
								It includes player movement, featuring a dash; several enemy types that each have different attack patterns and have different statistics; three distinct and appropriate
								levels to reflect these mechanics; a boss type enemy that summons objects; and animations that fit each action performed. Additionally, there is an appropriate UI
								featured on-screen, and several different menu screens depending on the player's situation. <br />

							<h2><u>Fundamentals of Game and Graphical System Development</u></h2>
							<h3>Pacman:</h3>
							<p>
								At the start of Semester 1, I was supplied with a skeleton code for a Pacman game using a custom built library called S2D.
								Throughout the 11 week course, I changed and updated the skeleton code from two sprites that do not interact, to a moving and animating Pacman
								that can interact with ghosts and munchies whilst playing different sounds and collected power-ups. <br />

							</p>
							<h3>OpenGL:</h3>
							<p>
								The main project for Semester 2 was to create a 3D graphical environment using the OpenGL custom library. Each week, new features were added, for example: 
								a moveable camera or spinning objects. Unlike the first semester, we were solely responsible for creating the graphical systems to render these images, and
								to create a fully functional camera. These would lay the groundwork to create a video game, if desired. <br />
